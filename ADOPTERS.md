| Keboola      | developers@keboola.com | For our [use-case](https://github.com/keboola/keboola-as-code/blob/main/docs/apps-proxy/overview.md) we needed to use `oauth2-proxy` as a library rather than as CLI tool. So we're maintaining our own [fork](https://github.com/keboola/go-oauth2-proxy) with some modifications. |
